**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I realized that although I knew the basics of how to use most commands, I did not necessarily have a good understanding of *why* I was using those commands. For example, though I used merge command, I did not have a good understanding of why the syntax was structured a certain way.

e.g. `git merge origin/master` -> why origin and why master?

or 

e.g. `![alt text](link/to/image/)"Image commentary" -> why 'alt text'?

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I learned that 'alt text' was just a place holder for whatever text we wanted to put in there. The 'alt text' is what blind people will hear when the webpage is read by the computer to them. And for 'git merge', it will merge the specified branch into the current branch.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked some questions clarifying markdown syntax. We couldn't find the 'conversation' tab originally and our guide helped us clarify why the button wasn't there (we'd already merged the changes). Our guide was very proactive in making sure that we knew what each command did. We didn't have to ask too many questions because she made sure that we understood what the syntax of the commands meant. 

**What still confuses you about git?**

I feel pretty clear on all things git, although I know that I need practice using popd and pushd (even if they weren't part of this challenge).

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was great. My partner and I worked together well; I felt that we were able to communicate efficiently. Our guide was just helpful enough. She allowed us to figure out problems ourselves before jumping into help us if we really needed help.
