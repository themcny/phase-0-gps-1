### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

When I started the GPS, I didn't quite grasp the concept of how to merge a change with the master branch locally. Related to that, I didn't fully understand the meaning of the origin and origin/master parts of the git merge/push commands.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The term origin is just the default name given to the remote repo, like how master is the name of the default main branch.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the them how I'm able to be more efficient in my use of git by avoiding having to put in the GitHub username and password after every push. Other than that, most of the things were fairly straight forward.

### What still confuses you about git?

The main thing that confuses me about git are more high-level concepts of how it interacts with my computer. Other than that, the basic concepts and commands aren't too hard to grasp.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I enjoyed it, it really allowed me to get comfortable working in a development space with someone else, which is something I'll have to learn to work in the tech industry in any capacity. It also allowed me to compare my level of understanding with someone else, to get an idea of what things I need to review, and what things I have down solid.
